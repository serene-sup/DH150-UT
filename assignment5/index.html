#Step 1)
##What is the main activity your project would support the users?
This product should be about to support users who are interested in learning more about certain health-related information or addressing concerns. Possible uses would include searching health symptoms or learning about a new condition or lifestyle.
##What is the basic need involved for that activity?
Basic needs include a computer with internet access, ability to physically search for desired information in the webpage, and awareness of one’s own curiosities or conditions.
##What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Traditional solutions would include contactings doctors or asking peers with similar experiences
##What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
With asking doctors or peers, users could find it difficult to contact them due to busy schedules or lack of contact information. Users could also be shy about their condition and would prefer to find answers to their issues anonymously. With technology, users can instead search concerns in the privacy of their own home and read information without revealing personal information to others.

#Step 2)
##What are the characteristics of users?
Users are generally young adults to adults who have access to technology and are capable of using the internet. These users are typically a wide range of professions but likely not in the health-care field.
##Where would the users do that activity?
Users would likely do the activity either in their home on their laptop or on their mobile device in public.
What would the users do to complete that activity? 
Users would complete the activity by searching symptoms, conditions, or any other areas of interest in Google or a frequented health-related website

#Step 3)
 ##Pick an observation method
I will be interviewing a user (within the target demographic) in their home (a place they would generally use this product)

#Step 4)
##Decide where to visit
As mentioned previously, I will visit them in their home
##Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
I will observe how they search for health-related information by asking them to complete a serious of tasks such as searching for symptoms, treatments, and diets
##Decide how to interact with the users 
I will interact with the users through observing their processes and asking open-ended questions on their thoughts as they complete tasks
##Decide how to collect user data
I will collect data through voice recording

#Reflection:
The overall process went smoothly and the participant was very compliant. She was very good about thinking aloud and sharing thoughts as she completed various tasks. From the interview data this participant provided, I was able to learn from a user’s perspective of the process in which one would go about learning more about a health-related topic and the method of selecting articles. One thing my participant mentioned was how she would select and article based on how interesting the titled sounded or if the title best matched the topic she was search. While this interview did go smoothly and very well, if I were to perform it again, I would select more niche questions and tasks for the user to perform to see how one would go about performing searches that are less general and find answers to questions that are less broad and easily covered by most health-related pages.
